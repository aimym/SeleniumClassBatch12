Notes:
Alerts:
Alert  is a popup message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

# types of Alerts:
1. web based alerts/html alerts-we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2.Javascript alerts/browser alerts by using switchTo method
            we cannot inspect any of the Javascript alerts
3. Windows based alerts- we cannot handle with Selenium

Types of JS alerts:
1.Simple alert-click OK
2.Confirmation alert-either cancel or click ok
3.prompt alert-enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1.accept()-click ok
2.dismiss()-click cancel
3.getText()
4.sendKeys()

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
Example: http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth
             //username:password@

Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage frame allow devs to represent multiple
views on one page

3 ways to interact with frames:
1. by index
2. by name
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch to allert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

Interview question: How do you handle Alerts in Selenium?
